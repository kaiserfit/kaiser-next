    opinion:
      "I highly recommend this app! It only took seconds to download. It takes up very little room in storage and has excellent performance. The second I got on it, it coached me and told me exactly what to do, and I'm usually not that active but still saw amazing results. Everything is customizable, and I also get told exactly what to do so I can continue to lose weight. This app is very good for all genders, ages, and body types and once you answer just a few questions at the beginning it will tell you exactly what you need to do.",
